# Digital Image Processing
Given a gray level image, the program will calculate the following properties:
- Mean value of the whole image
- Standard deviation of the whole image
- The minimum value of the gray level present in the image
- The maximum value of the gray level present in the image
- The range of gray levels present in the image
- The histogram of the image
- The normalized histogram of the image
- The histograms are made using two methods:
  - Outputing the values in the console and inserting them into an excel sheet
  - Scaling the histogram and running it through an algorithm to create a 256x256 image
